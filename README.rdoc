Attendance Tracker

Attendance Tracker is an app for Teachers to track their students attendance at after-school activities.  

It was created for Darren Bell's wife who works at a Non-Profit that pays for students to attend after-school activities.  She thought it would be nice to have a way to track that the students were attending the activities.
